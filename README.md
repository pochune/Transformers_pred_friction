The 'README' file  contains detailed information about the included datasets and the script used for conducting machine learning analysis.

1. 'Experimental_data': This dataset contains raw experimental data. It includes parameters such as slip velocity,
 accumulated slip, axial shortening, normal stress, shear stress, temperature, and friction. The units for each parameter are provided within the file. The file is formatted as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.

3. 'Script for analysis': This file contains the script or code used to carry out Transformers architecture in this study. 
It includes procedures such as data preprocessing, data splitting, construction of the training model, plotting of validation and test data, and tracing of attention weights. 
Additionally, it provides information regarding the hyperparameters used in the study ('#ref'). The file format for this data is .ipynb, and it is compatible with Jupyter Notebooks.

Please ensure you have the appropriate software correctly. 
We hope that these data and associated scripts provide a helpful resource for understanding the procedures and results discussed in this study.
